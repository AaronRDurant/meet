## Features
Here are the user stories and scenarios that guided the construction of meet.
### 1. Filter Events by City

#### Scenario 3: User can select a city from list of suggestions
- _Given_ the user typed Detroit in the city text box and the list of suggested cities is showing
- _When_ the user selects a city from the list
- _Then_ their city should be changed to the selected one, and the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city
### 2. Show/Hide Event Details
#### User Story:
- As a user, I should be able to click on an event, so that I can see more or less details about it.
#### Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default

- _When_ the user clicks on the expanded event
- _Then_ the event collapses, hiding the additional information
### 3. Specify Number of Events
#### User Story:
- As a user, I should be able to select how many events I wish to have displayed, so that I can organize the page in a manner convenient for me.
#### Scenario 1: When user hasn't specified a number, 32 is the default
- _Given_ the main page is open
- _When_ the app is loaded
- _Then_ the app will display 32 events

#### Scenario 1: Show cached data when there's no internet connection
- _Given_ the user isn't connected to the internet
- _When_ the user loads the app
- _Then_ the user is shown events in the city they last looked at
